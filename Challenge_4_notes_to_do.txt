So your StartQuiz function will loop through an array of question objects \

We need to create a "test-taker" object that stores a test-taker id and a score we can increment as they cycle through the questions - which means we need a way of identifying a correct answer in an object-question, and a function that notices whether the test taker chose the correct answer or not (if statement, and event listeners).\
\
You should update this information in local storage as soon as the event takes place. Once you have this functionality for a single question, you can worry about moving onto the next question. \
\
For now, think of it as a single question quiz. Either you get 1/1 or 0/1. \
\
Once the score has been updated, we need to re-run the for-loop for the next question object in the array. \
